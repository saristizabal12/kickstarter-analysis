# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The project composed of two parts. The first part, we had to organize the information, create pivot tables, and create charts. In order to see when were the launch dates.
On the second part, we created the outcome vs goals. By applying our knowledge in excel to create the percentage of numbers successful, numbers of failed, and number of canceled projects to get the total outcome.
### Purpose
In the first part, we had to create charts using the data to facilitate the summary through visuals. Second part consisted of the total outcomes of successful, failed and canceled projects.
## Analysis and Challenges
We analyzed and organized the data in order to allow provide us with the necessary information we needed. Some Challenges I met on the way was converting the Epoch dates to be easily read in the excel sheet. First step was to convert the first Epoch and then click the bottom right corner of the cell so it woul be converted to all cells in that column.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
For the launch date we concluded that May was the most successful month and December the least successful. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
In our analysis we found that the success rate surprassed the negative rate creating an overall positivie percent. There were no cancelations having allowing us to have raw data and inverse curve.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Challenges was creating the Countifs and the if errors. The code proke many times and I would have to go back and revise multiple time to confirm.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The outcomes base 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The highest success rate was between less than 1000 to 4999. With this knowledge, we can consider that most of those successes could have happened in the month of May.
1. There were no cancelations to have a neutral point. 2. We do not know who is going to the events (Sex, ethnic background, feedback, etc). 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could have also created the number successful plays vs the number of failures per country. Or bar graph of most plays by country or least plays by country. That can help visualize what countries to choosing from in the future.
